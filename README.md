# ‚óºÔ∏èüêì coq-of-noir

Noir is a Domain Specific Language for SNARK proving systems. With `coq-of-noir` we provide an **affordable way to formally verify smart contracts written in Noir**. We rely on the well-known proof assistant [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) for the verification work.

## Status

This is still a work in progress. Contact us at [Formal Land](https://formal.land/) if you are interested.

## License

`coq-of-noir` is free and open source. It is distributed under a dual license. (MIT/APACHE) The translation phase is based on the code of the Noir compiler, to maximize code reuse.
